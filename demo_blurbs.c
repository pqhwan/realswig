There exists a perfect match of supply and demand between
those who need things shipped and those who find travel
expenses burdensome.

When was the last time you sent something? 

Because no matter how big your package is, where it goes,
        or what time it is now, there's always somebody
        going there right now.

So why did nobody pay you for taking that long, expensive
ride up the coast last weekend?

"We are going against some of the most established corporations
on this planet--why?"

"because we think the traditional courier services are
outdated."

"we want to build a service that will"

"give everyday people access to better, faster and cheaper courier services"
     
"and also give them ways to travel at effectively zero cost."
you can now pay for your entire trip by simply 

"So how do we do it? What we need is you: normal people who travel\
between cities occasionally, or maybe frequently. 
Once we know"


The only way we can 
convince shippers that not only 

The only way shippers will consider our service (or rather, your service)
    an option

"The only way to convince shippers not only that our service (or if I may, your service)
    is an option, but also that it is immensely cheaper, faster, and nontheless
    ireliable"

    *once you register your package, its destination and the desired time of delivery
    we will let hundreds of transporters in your area know about it

    all the transporters registered on Swiggly are screened for their phone number
    and a payment method (a credit card or a paypal account) to confirm their identity
