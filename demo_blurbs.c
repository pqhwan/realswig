    *once you register your package, its destination and the desired time of delivery
    we will let hundreds of transporters in your area know about it
    
    "Tell us about your package, and we'll let people in your area know about it!"

    all the transporters registered on Swiggly are screened for their phone number
    and a payment method (a credit card or a paypal account) to confirm their identity
